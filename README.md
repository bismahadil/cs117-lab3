Assembly Reflections:
                    Registers are storage blocks inside the CPU.There are general purpose and special purpose registers and operations on these registers are much faster as compared to RAM.Instructions in assembly language are simple and they are of different types depending upon their function. Each CPU has its own instruction set architecture and syntax.
                   Python (high-level) is much simpler to read and understand as compared to assembly language (low-level) and has different syntax and gives commands or instructions in a completely different way.

Python Reflections:
                  Python is easier and faster because since it is a high-level language it is easier to understandand code in as compared to assembly language also, the syntax of assembly language is complex as compared to python. Python is comparatively much more easier to write and debug as it gives detailed errors. Also, python is platform-independent whereas assembly language is architecture-dependent.
                  Functions in python hide complex logic behind simple names, objects and classes refer to real world entities and also behaviours, and built-in data structures like lists help us with data-handling.

|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|Variable storage |    Register(RAX)  |      Heap       |  RAX is a CPU register and, heap is a memory location used to store objects
|                 |                   |                 |
|Printing output  |      syscall      |      Print()    | Syscall is system call for multiple tasks and print function simple gives output on screen

|   Arithmetic    |    mov rax, 5     |       c=a+b     |  High-level and easy syntax for arithmetic operations in python while in assembly language there are        |                 |    add rax, 3     |                 |   limited operations.
